<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About the Project

An interface for working with gists using the github REST API.  The system was originally developed developed by [Rudolph Miller](https://github.com/rudolph-miller/cl-gists) in 2015, however as of 2023 it has been abandoned for several years and no longer works with the current Github API.  This fork is for maintenance purposes. See the [original documentation](https://rudolph-miller.github.io/cl-gists/overview.html) for more information.


<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

An ANSI Common Lisp implementation. Developed and tested with
[SBCL](https://www.sbcl.org/).

### Installation

#### Automated Installation

If you have [Quicklisp](https://www.quicklisp.org/beta/) installed,
you can load `cl-gists` and all of its dependencies with:

```lisp
(ql:quickload :cl-gists)
```

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage
Set the following environment variables to hold your github credentials:

* GITHUB_USERNAME
* GITHUB_OAUTH_TOKEN

Github no longer works with a password, so don't bother setting that.  If you want a custom scheme for authentication, you can create one by following the examples in `examples/1.credentials.lisp`

Now to create a gist:
```lisp
(let ((gist (make-gist :description "sample"
                       :public t
                       :files '((:name "file1" :content "text1") (:name "file2" :content "text2")))))
  (create-gist gist))
;; => #S(GIST ...)
```

For more examples see the `examples/` directory in the source code.

## Notes
The tests have been updated to work with the latest github API, however there are some things to note:

* The tests need to authenticate to github using a particular user.  Some tests make assumptions about the contents of the users git repository.  For example the 'starred' tests checks that we can use the `:starred` keyword to `get-gists`, but if the user you're running the tests with doesn't have any starred gists then the test will fail.
* There are also some inconsistencies in test results depending on whether you repeat the tests.  Typically this shows up as "NODE-ID is/is not NIL.  On some runs this is returned by github, on others not, so the test results vary.
